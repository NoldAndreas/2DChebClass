# README #

2DChebClass is a code Andreas Nold and Ben Goddard developed as a project for classical density functional theory (DFT) and dynamic DFT (DDFT) computations at the group of Serafim Kalliadasis at Imperial College London. Since then, it evolved into a library of classes and functions to solve 1D and 2D DFT and DDFT problems.  Its use is not restricted to DFT and DDFT - it can be used to solve a wide range of (integro)-PDE systems in various 1D and 2D geometries.


### How do I run tests? ###
 
1. Please open "AddPaths.m" in the main folder. Define via "dirData" a folder where the computational results should be saved. 
2. Run any file in the Computations folder.
