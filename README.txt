2DChebClass is a code Andreas Nold and Ben Goddard developed as a project for DFT and DDFT computations in 2012 at Imperial College London. Since then, it evolved into a library of classes and functions to solve 1D and 2D DFT and DDFT problems.  Its use is not restricted to DFT and DDFT - it can be used to solve a wide range of (integro)-PDE systems in various 1D and 2D geometries.


### How do I run tests? ###

* Run any file in the Computations folder"

### Change Data Folder ###
 
Please open "AddPaths.m" in the main folder. Define via "dirData" a folder where the computational results should be saved. 


### Matlab-Versions

The code currently runs using Matlab2014a, Matlab2015a, Matlab2015b and Matlab2016a.
